# Overview

## The Challenge:
Build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user inputs and generatesa a SVG logo, cosequently saves it as "logo.svg" file. 'SVG' file could be described as 'rocket rising image format' which is built on vectos rather than convensional pixels. in demostration, a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and the passing of all of the tests available.


## User Story
```md
There is a desire to generate a simple logo for projects both as a student and as a researcher. This saves money on graphic designs and time resources.
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser

```

## Usage Instructions
1. Open integrated terminal on index.js
2. Enter “node index.js” in the command line
3. Through sequential order within the command line interface - the user will be presented with  questions,
- the user will provide a response to each question and proceed.
4. Once completed a SVG file named "logo.svg" will be created.
5. There is console.log that showes "congratulations, you have Generated a logo


## Installation Process
- Install the following: 
- Node.JS [Version 18.15.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.18.1/)
- Jest [Version 9.5.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest)
- Inquirer.js: [Version 8.2.4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4)


## Built With
- Tutor Assistant
- Saiyan Pride
- JavaScript
- npm version 9.5.0
- Node.js [Version 18.15.1]
- Inquirer.js: [Version 8.2.4]
- License Badge: (MIT)
- Visual Studio Code: 
- Internet Sources(google search, chatgpt, consultations)

## What I Learned
- Create an non-deployed application that invokes a “node index.js” in the command line to generate a logo and save it as a SVG file.
- Learned the JavaScript testing framework "Jest".
### Continued Development:
1. Keep learning as a Full Stack Developer
2. Add more user prompts to create more possibilities among a rendered SVG image.
